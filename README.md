# What-is-a-Front-End-Developer-

One way to get into web development is to learn one of the many popular front end languages. 
Then you can start making websites and apps. The code languages used to construct a website's 
front end—the part that visitors view when they visit the site using a web browser—include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and others. 

The creation of new websites and applications is a part of web development. It entails utilising full 
stack web development processes, including front end and back end development. In contrast to back end development, 
which deals with the inner workings of a website in browsers like Safari and Chrome, 
front end development is concerned with the user experience. Both of those tasks are combined in full stack development.
