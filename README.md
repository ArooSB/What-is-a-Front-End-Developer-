# What-is-a-Front-End-Developer-

Learning to code in one of the many popular front end web development languages is the first 
step in becoming a front end developer. Code languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are used to
construct the front end of a website, which is visible to users through their web browsers. 

One aspect of web development is the creation of new websites and apps. Applying full stack web development techniques, 
including front end and back end development, is what this entails. Web browsers' internal workings are the purview 
of back end developers, whereas front end developers pay more attention to the user experience. In full stack development, those two tasks are combined.
